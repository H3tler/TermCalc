# Build
**Run the following command to compile and run the program:**

    .\build.ps1

# Usage

### Operators in descending order of their precedence:
1. **'^'**
2. **'\*', '/', '%'**
3. **'+', '-'**

# Disclaimers

 1. **The error handling is very loose and almost non-existent but I'm hopefully going to try fixing that in the future.**
 2. **I didn't really follow any standard operator precedence for now so keep that in mind.**
