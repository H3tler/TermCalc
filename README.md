   ## Usage
   **Run the following command to compile and run the program:**

    .\build.ps1

## Disclaimers

 1. **The program currently can't handle negative numbers since it interprets the '-' sign as a minus but I'll fix that shortly.**
 2. **The error handling is very loose and almost non-existent but that's also something I'm planning to fix.**
 3. **I didn't really follow any standard operator precedence  for now so keep that in mind.**

## Operator Precedence
**The power operator '^' has the highest priority followed by the multiply, divide and mod operators and the plus and minus operators have the least priority.**
